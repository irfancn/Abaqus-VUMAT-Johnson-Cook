# Abaqus-VUMAT-Johnson_Cook

This VUMAT subroutine is to implement the Johnson-Cook model for explicit systems. The program contains iteration based on the the reduction of boundary instead of the Newton-Raphson method. This modification makes the program robust at the expense of running time. The plastic strain history is used to make the program efficient.
